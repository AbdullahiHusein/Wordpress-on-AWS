What is EC2? ðŸ¤”
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers (referred to as "instances") on which they can run their applications. EC2 instances are essentially virtual machines that can be launched in the cloud and scaled up or down as needed.
